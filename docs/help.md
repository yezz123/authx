# Help AuthX - Get Help 🦥

Do you like **AuthX**?

Would you like to help AuthX, other users, and the author?

Or would you like to get help with **AuthX**?

There are very simple ways to help (several involve just one or two clicks).

And there are several ways to get help too.

## Follow AuthX's Author

<a href="https://twitter.com/THyasser1" class="external-link" target="_blank">Follow @THyasser1 on **Twitter**</a> to get the latest news about **AuthX**.

## Star **AuthX** in GitHub

You can "star" AuthX in GitHub (clicking the star button at the top right): <a href="https://github.com/yezz123/AuthX" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/yezz123/AuthX</a>. ⭐️

By adding a star, other users will be able to find it more easily and see that it has been already useful for others.

## Watch the GitHub repository for releases

You can "watch" AuthX in GitHub (clicking the "watch" button at the top right): <a href="https://github.com/yezz123/AuthX class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/yezz123/AuthX</a>. 👀

There you can select **"Releases only"**.

By doing it, you will receive notifications (in your email) whenever there's a new release (a new version) of **AuthX** with bug fixes and new features.

## Help Author with issues in GitHub

You can see <a href="https://github.com/yezz123/AuthX/issues" class="external-link" target="_blank">existing issues</a> and try and help others, most of the times they are questions that you might already know the answer for. 🤓

## Watch the GitHub repository

You can "watch" AuthX in GitHub (clicking the "watch" button at the top right): <a href="https://github.com/yezz123/AuthX class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/yezz123/AuthX</a>. 👀

If you select "Watching" instead of "Releases only" you will receive notifications when someone creates a new issue.

Then you can try and help them solve those issues.

## Create issues

You can <a href="https://github.com/yezz123/AuthX/issues/new/choose" class="external-link" target="_blank">create a new issue</a> in the GitHub repository, for example to:

* Ask a **question** or ask about a **problem**.
* Suggest a new **feature**.

**Note**: if you create an issue, then I'm going to ask you to also help others. 😉

## Create a Pull Request

You can [contribute](contributing.md) to the source code with Pull Requests, for example:

* To fix a typo you found on the documentation.
* To help [translate the documentation](contributing.md) to your language.
  * You can also help to review the translations created by others.
* To propose new documentation sections.
* To fix an existing issue/bug.
* To add a new feature.
