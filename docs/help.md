# Help AuthX - Get Help 🦥

Do you like **AuthX**?

Would you like to help AuthX, other users, and the author?

Or would you like to get help with **AuthX**?

There are very simple ways to help (several involve just one or two clicks).

And there are several ways to get help too.

## Follow AuthX's Author

<a href="https://twitter.com/THyasser1" class="external-link" target="_blank">Follow
@THyasser1 on **Twitter**</a> to get the latest news about **AuthX**.

## Star **AuthX** in GitHub

You can "star" AuthX in GitHub (clicking the star button at the top right):
<a href="https://github.com/yezz123/AuthX" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/yezz123/AuthX</a>.
⭐️

By adding a star, other users will be able to find it more easily and see that
it has been already useful for others.

## Watch the GitHub repository for releases

You can "watch" AuthX in GitHub (clicking the "watch" button at the top right):
<a href="https://github.com/yezz123/AuthX class="external-link"
target="\_blank">https://github.com/yezz123/AuthX</a>. 👀

There you can select **"Releases only"**.

By doing it, you will receive notifications (in your email) whenever there's a
new release (a new version) of **AuthX** with bug fixes and new features.

## Help Author with issues in GitHub

You can see
<a href="https://github.com/yezz123/AuthX/issues" class="external-link" target="_blank">existing
issues</a> and try and help others, most of the times they are questions that
you might already know the answer for. 🤓

## Watch the GitHub repository

You can "watch" AuthX in GitHub (clicking the "watch" button at the top right):
<a href="https://github.com/yezz123/AuthX class="external-link"
target="\_blank">https://github.com/yezz123/AuthX</a>. 👀

If you select "Watching" instead of "Releases only" you will receive
notifications when someone creates a new issue.

Then you can try and help them solve those issues.

a new issue</a> in the GitHub repository, for example to:

- Suggest a new **feature**.

**Note**: if you create an issue, then I'm going to ask you to also help others.
